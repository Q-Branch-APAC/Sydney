Can you please create a Lightning Component that allows to capture orders. 
Customer has a process that allows to type in the quantity of required products for specific days - this includes a simple calendar view (essentially just a simple grid for a single week with the possibility to look a future weeks). 
Would be nice to add some simple logic to make some of the fields conditionally read-only. 

Best explained in person (the envisioned Lightning component is not overly complicated)
Business Value: Simplicty of order taking process is the key element of the current opportunity. Non of the OOTB/existing demo assets fits the bill
